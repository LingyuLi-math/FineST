About FineST
============

**FineST** (Fine-grained Spatial Transcriptomic) is a statistical model and toolbox to identify the super-resolved spatial co-expression (i.e., spatial association) between a pair of ligand and receptor.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Uniquely, **FineST** can distinguish co-expressed ligand-receptor pairs (LR pairs) from spatially separating pairs at sub-spot level or single-cell level, and identify the super-resolved interaction.
